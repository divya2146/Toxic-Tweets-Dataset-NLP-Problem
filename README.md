# Toxic-Tweets-Dataset-NLP-Problem
This project trains models to identify toxic tweets. It cleans text data, creates features, and trains models like Decision Trees. We then compare models and pick the best one for future tweet classification.

*This project aims to predict the toxicity of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We'll use a dataset of labeled tweets (toxic - 1, non-toxic - 0) and train various machine learning models to classify new tweets.

Workflow:-
1.Data Acquisition:
-Download the Toxic Tweets Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwiniyer176/toxic-tweets-dataset.
-Import necessary libraries like pandas for data manipulation.

2.Data Preprocessing :
-Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
-Explore the data: check for missing values, data types, etc.
-Preprocess the text data:
   a.Convert text to lowercase.
   b.Remove punctuation and special characters.
   c.Tokenize the text (split into words).
   d.Optionally, perform stemming or lemmatization (reduce words to their base form).

3.Feature Engineering:
-Create features for the model to learn from the text:
   a.Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represent each tweet as a vector where each element counts the frequency of a word in the tweet vocabulary.
   b.TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Similar to BoW but considers word importance based on frequency within a document and across all documents.

4.Model Training and Evaluation:
-Split the data into training and testing sets.
-Train different machine learning models for tweet toxicity prediction:
   a.Decision Tree Classifier
   b.Random Forest Classifier
   c.Naive Bayes Classifier
   d.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
   e.Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
   f.Logistic Regression Classifier                                   
-Evaluate each model's performance using metrics:
    a.Precision: Ratio of correctly predicted toxic tweets to all predicted toxic tweets.
    b.Recall: Ratio of correctly predicted toxic tweets to all actual toxic tweets.
    c.F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    d.Confusion Matrix: Visualization of true vs. predicted classifications.
    e.ROC-AUC Curve: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes (toxic vs. non-toxic).

5.Model Comparison and Selection (2 points):
-Compare the performance metrics of different models.
-Select the model with the best overall performance (e.g., highest F1-Score or ROC-AUC).

6.Testing and Deployment (2 points - Optional):
-Test the chosen model on unseen data to assess its generalizability.
-Optionally, deploy the model in a real-world application for tweet toxicity detection.

Tips:
-Use libraries like scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
-Consider techniques like data cleaning, stemming/lemmatization for better results.
-Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for each model to improve performance.
and also
-Trying different pre-processing techniques (e.g., stop word removal).
-Implementing more advanced feature engineering techniques.
-Evaluating additional classification models (e.g., deep learning models).

conclusion :
This project will culminate in a machine learning model capable of predicting the toxicity of a tweet based on its text content. The project will evaluate various models and select the one with the best performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) This chosen model can then be used to automatically classify new tweets as toxic or non-toxic.

Real time benifits of this project:

While this project focuses on building a model, the real-time benefits wouldn't come from this specific project itself, but from deploying the trained model. Here are some potential real-time benefits of a deployed tweet toxicity classifier:

-Improved Social Media Experience: Filtering out toxic content in real-time can create a more positive and inclusive online environment for social media users.
-Enhanced Brand Protection: Businesses can leverage such models to identify and address potential brand reputation issues arising from toxic comments or content.
-Content Moderation Automation: Automating tweet toxicity detection can assist moderators in prioritizing and handling large volumes of content, improving efficiency.
-Safer Online Interactions: Real-time detection of toxic content can help flag potential cyberbullying or harassment, allowing for quicker intervention.

It's important to remember that real-time benefits depend on integrating the trained model into a social media platform or content moderation system.
